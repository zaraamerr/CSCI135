//My first program in C++

#include <iostream>        //The built-in library for input/output
using namespace std;       //The names of standard definitions

int main()                 //C++ programs all have a main() function
{
  cout << "Hello, World!\n"; //Print "Hello, World!" and "C++ is fun" to terminal
  cout << "C++ is fun!";
  return 0;                //Standard way to end function
}
